# Twitter Network Survey

This is the code we used for conducting a social network survey on Twitter. It requires accounts at oauth and parse.

1. Requesting permission to access participants' Twitter data (oauth).
2. Requesting a list of participants' Twitter contacts (friends i.e. people followed, followers, or both) from the API.
3. Displaying a random selection of contacts (friends, followers, or both).
4. Each profile includes profile picture, name, and username (Twitter handle) of the target.
5. Participants are asked to classify contacts into 4 categories.
6. Next to each profile, 4 buttons are displayed, corresponding to the four categories.
7. The categorization is done by clicking on a button corresponding to the desired category.
8. After participants are ready to proceed, the results of the classification and all other data requested from the API are saved on Parse.
